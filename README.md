# Third Person Base

A sample project that lightly builds on the Third Person sample project provided
by Unity for use in prototyping.

- Input and Character Motor are separated, allowing modular control over character movement
- Removes dependency on Cinemachine, replaced with a standalone camera follow
- Reorganizes starter assets to use AssemblyDefinition assets
- Reorganizes starter code into "Unity.StarterAssets" namespace
